# zECC-Zebra-Wallet

Welcome to my version of the Electric Coin Company wallet for Zcash (zECC)

Inspired by NightHawk Wallet (https://github.com/nighthawk-apps/nighthawk-wallet-android) 
Based on zECC Wallet (https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet) from Electric Coin Company.

NightHawk branded their wallet on the F-117 Stealth Fighter, I just happen to like Zebras.

This is a working wallet that only supports SHIELDED transactions.

If you don't know what a shielded transaction is then now is the perfect time to learn more about Zcash, its important, its the future and the way these things should be done.

Extremely Important :-
- Electric Coin DO NOT support the zECC Wallet.
- NightHawk Apps DO NOT support the NightHawk wallet.
- THIS WALLET IS NOT SUPPORTED.

This wallet is a functioning plaything, an experiment, only use it for pocket change you're prepared to lose forever.

To install, download the APK file to your phone and install it - you also have to enable third-party apps in your phone settings.

Finally, don't forget :-

- Use this wallet at ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK
- It may cause global warming, plague and economic catastrophe (all of which have happened so far this year)

No zebras were harmed in the production of this app, none of the graphics contain real zebra skin.

# zECC-Zebra-Wallet
My version of the Electric Coin Company zECC wallet for Zcash

This was inspired by the NightHawk wallet (https://github.com/nighthawk-apps/nighthawk-wallet-android) which uses the zECC wallet for Zcash (https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet) from Electric Coin Company.

NightHawk branded their wallet with the F-117 Stealth Fighter, I just happen to like Zebras

Electric Coin don't support this software as their wallet is example code for the world to play with.
NightHawk don't support their wallet, and guess what... I don't support this wallet either!!

Its a plaything, an experiment, don't use it for anything more than pocket change you're prepared to lose forever.

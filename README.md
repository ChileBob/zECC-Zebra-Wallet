# ChileBobs Zebra Wallet

Welcome to my version of the Electric Coin Co wallet for Zcash (zECC)

Its based on zECC Wallet (https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet) from Electric Coin Company.

Inspired by NightHawk Wallet (https://github.com/nighthawk-apps/nighthawk-wallet-android) who are building a completely private wallet based on zECC.

NightHawk branded their wallet on the F-117 Stealth Fighter, I just happen to like Zebras.

This is a working wallet that only supports SHIELDED ZCASH transactions, differences between this and zECC wallet are mainly cosmetic (graphics, layout, etc) but I have plans for a few new things.

This is extremely important :-
- Electric Coin DO NOT support their wallet.
- NightHawk Apps DO NOT support their wallet.
- THIS WALLET IS NOT SUPPORTED !!!

This wallet is a functioning plaything, an experiment, only use it for pocket change you're prepared to lose forever.

To install, download the APK file to your phone and open it. You also have to enable third-party apps in your phone settings.

Finally, don't forget :-

- Use ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK
- This wallet may cause global warming, plague and economic catastrophe (all of which have happened recently)
- Make a note of the backup phrases when you create a wallet, just in case it all goes horribly wrong.

If you feel the urge to buy me a beer, here's my z-address (no, it doesn't mean zebra address, although...)

No zebras were harmed in the production of this app, none of the graphics contain real zebra skin.

# zECC-Zebra-Wallet
My version of the Electric Coin Company zECC wallet for Zcash

Inspired by the NightHawk wallet (https://github.com/nighthawk-apps/nighthawk-wallet-android) which uses the zECC wallet for Zcash (https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet) from Electric Coin Company.

NightHawk branded their wallet on the F-117 Stealth Fighter, I just happen to like Zebras more than aircraft.

- Electric Coin DO NOT support this software, their wallet is example code for the world to play with.
- NightHawk DO NOT support their wallet.
- Guess what? I DO NOT support this wallet!

This wallet is a plaything, an experiment, don't use it for anything more than pocket change that you are prepared to lose forever.

To install, download the APK file to your phone and install it - you also have to enable third-party apps in your phone settings.

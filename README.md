# ChileBobs Zebra Wallet

Welcome to my version of the Electric Coin Co wallet for Zcash (zECC)

Its based on zECC Wallet (https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet) from Electric Coin Company.
Inspired by NightHawk Wallet (https://github.com/nighthawk-apps/nighthawk-wallet-android)

NightHawk branded their wallet on the F-117 Stealth Fighter, I just happen to like Zebras.

This is a working wallet that only supports SHIELDED ZCASH transactions.

If you don't know what a shielded transaction is, now is the perfect time to learn more about Zcash. 
Its important, its the future and its the way these things should be done.

Extremely Important :-
- Electric Coin DO NOT support their wallet.
- NightHawk Apps DO NOT support their wallet.
- THIS WALLET IS NOT SUPPORTED !!!

This wallet is a functioning plaything, an experiment, only use it for pocket change you're prepared to lose forever.

To install, download the APK file to your phone and install it - you also have to enable third-party apps in your phone settings.

Finally, don't forget :-

- Use ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK
- It may cause global warming, plague and economic catastrophe (all of which have happened recently)


*No zebras were harmed in the production of this app, none of the graphics contain real zebra skin.
